# This script would be used to preprocess the raw demonstration data collected
# by `collect_demo.py` into a format suitable for the `GuiActionDataset`.

# The process would involve:
# 1. Loading the raw log files (mouse/keyboard events and screenshot paths).
# 2. Segmenting the continuous data into discrete (state, action, next_state) steps.
# 3. Normalizing actions (e.g., converting absolute screen coordinates to relative).
# 4. Structuring the data, perhaps into a Parquet or CSV file, with columns for:
#    - instruction
#    - pre_screenshot_path
#    - action_type (e.g., 'click', 'type')
#    - action_details (e.g., coordinates, text)
#    - post_screenshot_path
