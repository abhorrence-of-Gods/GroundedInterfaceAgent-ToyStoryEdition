# This script would be used to collect human demonstration data.
# It would:
# 1. Start a listener for mouse and keyboard events.
# 2. Take a screenshot before and after each action (e.g., a click or keypress).
# 3. Log the sequence of (state, action, next_state) triplets.
# 4. Allow the user to annotate the high-level instruction for the task.

# Due to the complexity and security implications of keylogging and screen
# recording, the implementation is left as a conceptual placeholder.
